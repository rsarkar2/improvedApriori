# Improved Apriori R Package
This is an R package to identify frequently co-occurring drug/vaccine and adverse event (AE) pairs from safety datasets using either the classical Apriori method ("Confidence" as second hyperparameter) or an improved Apriori method (using "ROR", "RR", or "PRR" as the second hyperparameter)

The user can select a dataset and the number of drugs/vaccines, number of AEs, and the number of reports as arguments in the function.
